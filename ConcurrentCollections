Concurrent Collections

1️⃣ CopyOnWriteArrayList

✅ Definition

CopyOnWriteArrayList is a thread-safe List implementation where all mutative operations (add, remove, update) create a new copy of the underlying array, allowing lock-free and consistent reads.

🔹 Key Characteristics

✔ Thread-safe
✔ Read operations are lock-free
✔ Write operations are synchronized (locked)
✔ No ConcurrentModificationException
✔ Best for read-heavy scenarios

🔥 Interview Line

CopyOnWriteArrayList achieves thread safety by copying the array on writes and allowing lock-free reads on immutable snapshots.

2️⃣ CopyOnWriteArraySet
✅ Definition

CopyOnWriteArraySet is a thread-safe Set implementation backed by a CopyOnWriteArrayList, ensuring no duplicates and providing lock-free read operations.

🔹 Key Characteristics

✔ Thread-safe
✔ No duplicates
✔ Lock-free reads
✔ Slower writes
✔ Maintains insertion order


🔥 Interview Line
CopyOnWriteArraySet provides thread-safe uniqueness by delegating storage to CopyOnWriteArrayList and using snapshot-based reads.
