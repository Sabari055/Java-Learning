Java Collections Framework

Why Collections?

Problem with Arrays - Fixed Size and no in built methods like (add/remove/search utilities).
Backend app need dynamic, fast, scalable data handling. Collection solves this


Collection Framework architecture

	Iterable
	   |
	Collection
	   |
	-------------------------------------
	|                 |                 |
	List              Set               Queue


Separate Hierarchy 

	Map
 	|
	----------------------------
	|             |            |
	HashMap   LinkedHashMap  TreeMap


Implementations of List interfaces

	List (Interface)
 	|
 	---------------------------------------------------
	|                  |                |             |
	ArrayList       LinkedList        Vector        Stack

	List interface has an ordered, index based, and duplicates allowed collection.

Array List

⦁	Dynamic Array,
⦁	random access is fast,
⦁	Not thread safe	

Internal implementations of Array list

⦁	Backed by Object[] array with initial capacity of 10 and when exceeded it will grow by 50%.
⦁	If size is know before we can give custom Capacity like 100, 1000 it will improve performance because resizing is costly.
⦁	Array list achieves fast random access by its internal architecture object array[].
⦁	List implements RandomAccess Marker interface.

Linked List

Linked list implements List and Deque interfaces, so it can behave like 

List - ordered Collection
Queue and stack

LinkedList supports index-based operations, but internally it is node-based. Methods like get(index) and add(index) require traversal, so they are O(n). Java optimizes traversal by starting from head or tail depending on index position.

LinkedList stores elements as nodes, where each node contains:

⦁	Data
⦁	Reference to previous node
⦁	Reference to next node

➡ It is a Doubly Linked List
