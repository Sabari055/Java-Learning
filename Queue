1️⃣ What is Queue? (One-Line Answer)
Queue is a Collection designed to hold elements prior to processing, typically following FIFO (First-In-First-Out) order.

📌 Package: java.util

2️⃣ Queue Hierarchy (Interface vs Class)

Iterable                    (interface)
   ↑
Collection                  (interface)
   ↑
Queue                       (interface)
   │
   ├── Deque                (interface)
   │     ├── ArrayDeque     (class)
   │     └── LinkedList     (class)
   │
   ├── PriorityQueue        (class)
   │
   └── BlockingQueue        (interface - concurrent)
         ├── ArrayBlockingQueue      (class)
         ├── LinkedBlockingQueue     (class)
         ├── PriorityBlockingQueue   (class)
         ├── DelayQueue              (class)
         └── SynchronousQueue        (class)

1️⃣ PriorityQueue (Class)
🔹 Internal Structure

Binary Heap (Min-Heap by default)

🔹 Key Points to Say
Does not follow FIFO
Elements are ordered by:
Natural order
Comparator

Head is smallest element
❌ Not thread-safe
❌ No null allowed

🔹 Time Complexity
Insert: O(log n)
Remove: O(log n)

🔹 When to Use
✔ Scheduling
✔ Priority-based processing

2️⃣ Deque (Interface)
Deque = Double Ended Queue
Insert / remove from both ends
Can behave as:
Queue (FIFO)
Stack (LIFO)

3️⃣ ArrayDeque (Class)
🔹 Internal Structure
Resizable circular array

🔹 Key Points to Say
Faster than Stack & LinkedList
No capacity restriction
❌ No null elements
Not thread-safe

🔹 When to Use
✔ Stack replacement
✔ High-performance queue

4️⃣ LinkedList (as Queue)
🔹 Internal Structure
Doubly Linked List

🔹 Key Points to Say
Implements:
List
Deque
Queue
Allows null
Slower than ArrayDeque

6️⃣ BlockingQueue (🔥 Concurrent Queue)

Used in producer–consumer scenarios

🔹 BlockingQueue Interface
Thread-safe
Blocks when:
Queue is full (producer)
Queue is empty (consumer)

Commom impl:
ArrayBlockingQueue
LinkedBlockingQueue
PriorityBlockingQueue etc.,
